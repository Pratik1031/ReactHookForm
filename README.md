React Hook Form: A library for managing forms in React with a focus on performance and developer experience.
Material-UI: A React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, making it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests.
Yup: A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
Vite: A fast development server and build tool for modern web development.
Material Icons: A collection of Google's Material Design icons.
Features
Form Validation: Utilizes Yup for form validation to ensure that user inputs meet specified criteria.
Material Design: The form is styled using Material-UI components for a clean and consistent user interface.
Asynchronous Data Submission: Axios is employed to handle asynchronous data submission to a RESTful API.
Country Dropdown: Uses the RestCountries API to dynamically populate a dropdown with a list of countries.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
